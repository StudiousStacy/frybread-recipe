    <h1>Native Frybread</h1>
    <p>This is a delicious homemade frybread recipe that is simple, quick, and full of flavor. This bread was made up by Native Americans when rations were given to them by the military back in the 1800s.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 cups flour</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 cup warm water (or a little more)</li>
      <li>1 - 2 cup shortening or 1 - 2 cup cooking oil (preference)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Mix the flour, baking powder and salt in a large bowl. Gradually stir in the water and work it in, adding more water a little at a time, if needed.</li>
      <li>Knead by hand until soft but not sticky. Form the dough into a round ball, cover and let stand for about 30 minutes. Shape into 2" balls.</li>
      <li>Heat shortening or cooking oil in a 1 1/2 " deep frying pan until hot.</li>
      <li>Flatten each ball of dough by patting and stretching into a pizza shape. Carefully place the dough into the hot oil.</li>
      <li>Fry until edges of the bread are golden and turn to cook the other side. Makes 4-5 pieces.</li>
    </ol>
